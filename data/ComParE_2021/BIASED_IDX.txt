Some files were up-sampled to 16kHz, including these files would lead to biased results. Hence, we remove these files from the original dataset. The original files indexes are provided below:

(*Notice that indexes start from 001 instead of 000)

- training set:
- development set:
- test set (8 files): 197, 188, 127, 106, 064, 052, 041, 036

When removing biased files from the original data folder, please follow the descending order (e.g., 197->188->...->036). Remember to also remove these files from the label files to ensure the data-label consistency.
